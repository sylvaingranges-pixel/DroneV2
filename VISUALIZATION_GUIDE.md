# Test Results and Visualizations

This directory contains the results of the closed-loop MPC implementation with continuity constraints.

## Generated Visualizations

### Main Comparison Plots

1. **comparison_strategies.png** - Full comparison of three control strategies:
   - Open-loop MPC (single optimization)
   - Closed-loop MPC without continuity constraints
   - Closed-loop MPC with continuity constraints
   
   Shows:
   - Control inputs over time
   - Control rate (shows jumps/discontinuities)
   - Load position tracking
   - Cable angle evolution

2. **comparison_zoom_jumps.png** - Zoomed view of first 3 seconds:
   - Control input comparison
   - Control rate comparison highlighting jumps
   - Recalculation points marked with vertical lines
   - Clear visualization of jump reduction with continuity constraints

### Closed-Loop Test Results

Individual test results showing different scenarios:

- **closed_loop_20m_without_continuity.png** - 20m target without continuity
- **closed_loop_20m_with_continuity.png** - 20m target with continuity
- **closed_loop_40m_without_continuity.png** - 40m target without continuity (with initial velocity)
- **closed_loop_40m_with_continuity.png** - 40m target with continuity (with initial velocity)

### Control Smoothness Analysis

Detailed analysis of control smoothness:

- **control_smoothness_closed_loop_20m_without_continuity.png**
- **control_smoothness_closed_loop_20m_with_continuity.png**
- **control_smoothness_closed_loop_40m_without_continuity.png**
- **control_smoothness_closed_loop_40m_with_continuity.png**

Each shows:
- Control input trajectory
- Control rate of change (m/s³)
- Statistics: Max jump, Mean jump

## Key Results

### Control Smoothness Improvements

| Metric | Without Continuity | With Continuity | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Max Control Rate** | 300.0 m/s³ | 189.5 m/s³ | **36.8%** ↓ |
| **Mean Control Rate** | 32.0 m/s³ | 18.8 m/s³ | **41.3%** ↓ |
| **Large Jumps (>50 m/s³)** | 21 | 12 | **43%** ↓ |

### Tracking Performance

Both strategies achieve excellent tracking:
- Without continuity: 0.06 m error
- With continuity: 0.26 m error

The small increase in error is a reasonable trade-off for the significant improvement in control smoothness.

## Interpretation

### What to Look For in the Plots

1. **Control jumps**: Sharp vertical transitions in control rate plots
   - Red vertical lines indicate discontinuities
   - Fewer and smaller jumps = better smoothness

2. **Load tracking**: Load position should converge smoothly to target
   - Both strategies achieve good tracking
   - With continuity is slightly more gradual

3. **Cable oscillations**: Cable angle should dampen to zero
   - Smooth control reduces oscillation amplitude
   - Better for mechanical system longevity

4. **Control effort**: Area under |control| curve
   - Smoother control typically uses less total effort
   - More energy efficient

## Conclusion

The visualizations clearly demonstrate that continuity constraints:
✅ Significantly reduce control jumps
✅ Create smoother control trajectories
✅ Maintain excellent tracking performance
✅ Provide practical benefits for real-world implementation
